This project is Capstone project for my final year Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management, India

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

It is inspired by and a practical implementation of the paper [Research of a Possibility of Using Blockchain Technology without Tokens to Protect Banking Transactions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8657279)

## Development

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Testing

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests
